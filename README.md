# Holberton School Shell

This repository contains my shell projects for Holberton School. The goal of these projects is to master the basics of Bash scripting, Unix command line tools, file management, permissions, input/output redirections, and shell environment configuration.

## Repository Structure

- `basics/`  
  Scripts covering fundamental shell commands: navigation, file and directory management, and basic Bash usage.

- `permissions/`  
  Scripts focused on Unix file permissions, ownership, and related commands.

- `io_redirections_and_filters/`  
  Scripts demonstrating input/output redirections, pipes, and text processing filters.

- `init_files_variables_and_expansions/`  
  Scripts about shell initialization files, environment variables, and shell expansions.

## Key Concepts

- Bash scripting fundamentals
- File and directory manipulation
- Permission and ownership management
- Input/output redirection and piping
- Text processing with standard Unix tools
- Shell environment configuration and variable management

## Usage

To run any script, make sure it is executable:

```bash
chmod +x script_name
./script_name
```

Replace `script_name` with the actual file name you want to execute.

## Requirements

- All scripts are written for Bash and tested on Ubuntu.
- Each script is self-contained and performs a single task.
- Scripts are intended for educational purposes and follow Holberton School guidelines.
